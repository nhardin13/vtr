## Estimate & Diagnostic Fees

<div class="page-content">

### $35 Diagnostic Fee

When you bring in equipment for repair, we provide a **free visual inspection** to determine what's needed. If you want a detailed diagnosis with full parts lookup and labor estimate, there's a **$35 diagnostic fee**.

**This fee is waived if you proceed with the repair.**

The diagnostic includes:
- Complete equipment inspection
- Problem identification and diagnosis  
- Parts research and sourcing
- Detailed written estimate
- Labor estimate before work begins

### What If I Don't Proceed?

If you choose not to proceed with repairs after the diagnostic, the $35 fee covers our time and expertise. This protects both of us and ensures honest, upfront pricing.

If you do decide to go forward, **the $35 diagnostic fee is completely waived**—you won't pay it separately.
