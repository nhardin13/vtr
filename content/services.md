A $40.00 estimate fee is due for equipment that is NOT repaired, which covers the cost of the diagnosis and time spent looking up required parts for the repair. The estimate fee is waived if the customer chooses to have the equipment repaired.

Equipment pickup and delivery is available upon request for an additional fee starting at $50, depending on distance. Mower or equipment width cannot exceed 72".

### Repair Warranty Information

Your satisfaction is my guarantee. I thoroughly test and confirm that the repairs I complete fix the issue(s). In the rare event that your equipment is still not functioning properly, I will correct any issues cost free to you within 30 days.
